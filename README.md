# Pig-Game

## Start rolling the dice.
Keep adding to your number, trying to get the highest number you can before you hit 1. 
Once you hit #1, your score resets and it is the next players turn. 
Basically roullette for dice. 

Built with basic vanilla Javascript.

Play the game, see how everything works.
